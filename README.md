# rot13-file-decoder-encoder

A simple Javascript program that can encode and decode the contents within a text file to and from the rot13 encryption type.

If the contents of the file are already rot13 encrypted, the program will print to the terminal the decrypted file contents. Otherwise, if the contents of the file have not yet been encrypted, the program will print to the terminal the encrypted contents of the file.
